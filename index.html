    <h2>Manifesto</h2>
    <p>
        Ignore everything you know about Star Wars except for the original
        movie. Flush from your mind all notions of prequels or sequels or
        paperback novels or lackluster MMOFPS games or fan-maintained wiki
        drama.
    </p>
    <p>
        Recall how you felt while watching the binary sunset for the first time.
        I cannot speak for you, but my own feelings mirrored Luke's yearning to
        answer the call to adventure. A universe ripe with potential had just
        been established. Tantalizing hints of ancient glory, alien cultures,
        pernicious evil, and heroic struggles awaited us.
    </p>
    <p>
        That's the feeling I mean to evoke.
